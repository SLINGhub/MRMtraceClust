# Save chromatograms extracted from mzML files as CSV files
-   One CSV file per MRM feature
-   Each CSV file: 1st column contains Retention Times, subsequent columns contain intensities of samples

```{r message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/mrm_mzml_tools.R"))

# replace with the path where the mzml files are stored. Skip here if absolute path
DATA_PATH <- here("data/raw/mzML/Test")
OUTPUT_PATH <- here("output")

mrm_chroms <- convert_mzml_to_csv(path_mzml = DATA_PATH, path_output = OUTPUT_PATH)

```

# Plot chromatograms
